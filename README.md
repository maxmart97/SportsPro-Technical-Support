# SportsPro_Application

This application serves as a faux technical support program. I developed this program in parts for my programming class during the Fall 2018 semester.

The application runs in Visual Studio, however it uses a database from an SQL Server that I have running on my local machine. Therefore, the program will not function properly without access to the server. I might try to put the database on a cloud SQL server at some point, but for now, the database is only on my computer.

This application uses ADO.NET, LINQ TO SQL, and object data sources. Use of these varies depending on the point in the semester when each part of the application was developed.

12/01/2018: DEVELOPMENT STILL IN PROGRESS.
